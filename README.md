# My Pi configuration

Part of [alexandru/agents-config](https://github.com/alexandru/agents-config).

## Installation

<details>
<summary>STEP 1 — Clone the repository</summary>

### Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alexandru/pi-config.git ~/.pi/agent
```

If the path is not standard, set `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` in `~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, or `~/.profile`:

```sh
export PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR="/absolute/path/to/pi-config"
```

The bundled `subagent` extension starts child `pi` processes, so `pi` must remain on `PATH`. It requires Pi 0.84.2 or later.

<summary>STEP 2 — Install the shared skills globally</summary>

### Install the shared skills globally

```sh
cd ~/.pi/agent
make install-skills
```

The skills are installed under `~/.agents/skills`, where Pi, OpenCode, Copilot CLI,
and Codex can share them.
</details>

<summary>STEP 3 — Choose a configuration preset</summary>

### Choose a configuration preset

The [pi-switch](./bin/pi-switch.js) utility is for quickly switching between multiple setting presets (e.g., multiple sets of models assigned to your agents).

```sh
# Example
./bin/pi-switch w-openai
```

The switcher generates `settings.json` (Pi's configuration file) and `agents.models.json`
(per-agent models for the `subagent` extension) from:

- [pi.common.jsonc](./pi.common.jsonc)
- [pi.presets.jsonc](./pi.presets.jsonc)

**WARNING:** Must run `pi-switch` at least once, otherwise Pi's configuration is missing!

<summary>STEP 4 — Install Cellar (optional)</summary>

### Install Cellar (optional)

[Cellar](https://github.com/VirtusLab/cellar) is useful for JVM dependency API lookup, and this repo's [Makefile](./Makefile) also installs its associated skill.

Install [Coursier](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-installation) first:

```sh
## MacOS
brew install coursier/formulas/coursier
cs setup

## Linux x86-64 (aka AMD64)
curl -fL "https://github.com/coursier/launchers/raw/master/cs-x86_64-pc-linux.gz" | gzip -d > cs

## Linux ARM64
curl -fL "https://github.com/VirtusLab/coursier-m1/releases/latest/download/cs-aarch64-pc-linux.gz" | gzip -d > cs
```

Then install Cellar via Coursier:

```sh
cs install --contrib cellar
cellar --version

# Disable telemetry
cellar telemetry disable
```

## Defined agents

Main agents:

- [Orchestrator](./agents/Orchestrator.md) (default agent): designs and implements changes; delegates evidence, research, and checks.

Sub-agents:

- [Junior](./agents/Junior.md): bounded execution, mechanical work.
- [Explorer](./agents/Explorer.md): read-only codebase evidence gathering.
- [Librarian](./agents/Librarian.md): read-only external documentation and dependency-source research.

## Defined commands

Commands use currently selected primary agent and do not override it.

- `/plan`: prepare a detailed implementation plan and save it as a Markdown specification file.
- `/grill-me`: stress-test a plan or decision.
- `/grill-with-docs`: sharpen a plan or design while creating domain documentation.
- `/handoff`: prepare context for another agent or session.
- `/implement`: implement work from a specification or set of tickets.
- `/improve-codebase-architecture`: find and work through codebase architecture improvements.
- `/setup-matt-pocock-skills`: configure the repository for Matt Pocock's engineering skills.
- `/simplify`: simplify code without changing its behavior.
- `/to-spec`: turn the current conversation into a published specification.
- `/to-tickets`: break a plan or specification into tracer-bullet tickets.

## Shared skills

- [alexandru/skills](https://github.com/alexandru/skills/)
  - `code-review`: review changed code for bugs, structural problems, performance issues, and unintended behavior.
  - `simplify`: behavior-preserving code cleanup.

  - `codebase-design`: deep-module design vocabulary and principles.
  - `diagnosing-bugs`: disciplined diagnosis for hard bugs and regressions.
  - `domain-modeling`: domain language and architectural decisions.
  - `grill-with-docs`: sharpen a plan or design while creating domain documentation.
  - `grilling`: structured decision-tree interviews.
  - `handoff`: prepare context for another agent or session.
  - `implement`: implement work from a specification or set of tickets.
  - `improve-codebase-architecture`: find and work through codebase architecture improvements.
  - `resolving-merge-conflicts`: merge and rebase conflict resolution.
  - `setup-matt-pocock-skills`: configure a repository for the engineering skills.
  - `tdd`: test-first development guidance.
  - `to-spec`: turn the current conversation into a published specification.
  - `to-tickets`: break a plan or specification into tracer-bullet tickets.
- [VirtusLab/cellar](https://github.com/VirtusLab/cellar/)
  - `cellar`: query the APIs of JVM dependencies (Scala, Java).
- [JuliusBrussee/caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman)
  - `caveman`: token-efficient response modes with preserved technical accuracy.
- [cursor/plugins](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack/skills/unslop)

## Updating shared skills

```sh
make update-skills
```

This reinstalls the configured global skill roster from its upstream sources.
